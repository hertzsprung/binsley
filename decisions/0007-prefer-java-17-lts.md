# 7. Prefer Java 17 LTS

Date: 2023-06-13

## Status

Accepted

## Context

A programming language should be preferred that is openly available, widely supported, with mature development tools and a large Q&A community.

## Decision

Prefer Java 17 LTS as the standard programming language, particularly since it is natively supported by [AWS Lambda][lambda-java17].

## Consequences

Improvements released in later Java versions will be unavailable.
