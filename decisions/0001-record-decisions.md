## Status

Accepted

## Context

A lightweight, standard format is desired to record the motivation, choices, and tradeoffs of all substantial decisions, including architectural decisions.

## Consequences

A complete, chronological record of decisions will be available.
To avoid writing becoming onerous, records should remain brief.
