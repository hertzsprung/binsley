# 6. Prefer AWS managed services

Date: 2023-06-13

## Status

Accepted

## Context

A provider should be preferred that offers a wide range of managed services with costs that scale to zero.

## Decision

Prefer [AWS][aws] to provide compute, storage, security, and monitoring services.

## Consequences

Interoperability between services typically simplifies implementation and reduces costs, but also reduces application and infrastructure portability.
